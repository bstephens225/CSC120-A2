What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think I got everything to work in the end, but I had a lot of trouble working out the formatting. It's been a while since I used python and this was a needed refresher! Specifically I struggled to remember how to call a method that I had written for a new class so I could test all my methods. Advice I would give is to use the debug feature because I often found that I didn't realize where I was going wrong.
